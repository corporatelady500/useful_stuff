# Usefull Stuff
Just a few things I threw together for the Intro to Programming students.

### Git

* [Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/)
* [Visualizing Git](http://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/)
* [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/)

### Useful Git Commands

* `git diff`
  * Show the diff between all modified files.
* `git diff --cached`
  * Show the difference between all modifed files that have been staged.
* `git reset HEAD~`
  * Undo local commit. This will keep your changes as unstaged changes.
* `git checkout <branch>`
  * Change branches
* `git checkout -b <branch>`
  * Create new local branch.

### Python

* [Learn Python](https://www.learnpython.org/)
  * There are a number of language resources here. Sometimes it helps to look at other ways of doing things. There's an infinate number of ways to program the same functionality.
